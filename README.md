### Hi there 👋

Wow! I have the whole `.md` file to talk about myself. Where do I start?

Well, anything I write here is a self ad about myself. So here is what I would like to share:

#### How I get into programming:

I used to be a tomboy in middle school. At the end of 6th grade, the group of boys that I was fighting with received some rewards for Pascal competitions. Couldn't beat them up physically, I signed up to learn Pascal and was determine to beat them in competitions. After all the competitions we went through together, those boys became my closest friends. And I am forever grateful for the career that they introduced me to.

I think I shared too much about myself already.

Have a nice day!
